    Retrieve the most relevant information from the available sources for the user query: {query}.
    Always try to use the 'DocumentSearchTool' first to search the provided PDF knowledge base.
    If the information is not found or is incomplete in the PDF, then use the 'SerperDevTool' for a general web search
    to find up-to-date and relevant information.
    If the 'SerperDevTool' provides a specific URL that looks highly relevant, consider using the 'FireCrawlWebSearchTool'
    to scrape the content from that specific URL for detailed extraction.
    Your final output should be the most relevant information in text format.
